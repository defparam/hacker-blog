# About

Hi, I'm Evan! also known as [defparam](https://x.com/defparam). I'm a security researcher with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). I'm mainly interested in binary fuzzing, reverse-engineering, web security and hardware development. This site is where I keep my notes and stories of various interesting tooling I create or stumble upon.
